      <h3> about me </h3>
      <p>Welcome! I’m Alyssa Fell, a second-year journalism and interaction design student at Northeastern University with a strong interests in reporting, lifestyle journalism and photojournalism. I grew up in New Jersey and am Boston based.</p>

      <p>I often say that journalism is the best way to break out of one’s comfort zone and keep learning. For me, it allowed me to push my boundaries and become more confident in my approach and everyday life. I gained interpersonal and communication skills and continue to explore my ever-growing curiosities.</p>

      <p>I have a core foundation in AP style, along with photography, video and sound editing.</p>

      <p>Passionate for art and design, I grew up drawing, painting and sewing. This led to my interest and appreciation for fashion. During my first year of college, I further explored my interested in graphic design. I am knowledgeable in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Premiere. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>Throughout my career I hope to explore the intersection of journalism and design with an emphasis on interviewing and reporting.</p>

      <p>I am a news correspondent for The Huntington News, Northeastern University’s independent newspaper, and website chair for the Eta Kappa chapter of Kappa Delta. I was previously a WeSupport Mentee in The Women’s Interdisciplinary Society of Entrepreneurship (WISE) at Northeastern University and the Outreach, Social Media and Marketing Intern for Girls’ LEAP.</p>

      <p>I am eager and excited to further explore the journalistic field.</p>

      <p>Please feel free to reach out!</p>
